# My Thesis Published in PoPETS

Iâ€™m excited to share that my thesis has been officially published in **PoPETS** (Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium). It was an incredible journey working on this project, and seeing it recognized at such a prestigious symposium is a huge achievement.

The thesis explores [Implementation and Performance Assessment of a complex sign-cryption Protocol on a Constrained Device (micro-controller)], aiming to address the [Confidential Disclosure of Drone Pilot Location in Remote ID]. The paper was presented by my supervisor and co-author where we recieved a positve feedback from peers and experts in the field.
